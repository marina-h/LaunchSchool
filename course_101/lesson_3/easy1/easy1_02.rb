# Exercises: Easy 1
# Question 2

# "!" at the end of a method often implies that the method is destructive
# (mutates the caller), but is not always the case. "?" at the end of a method
# implies that the method returns true or false.

# 1. "!=" means not equals and would be used to determine if two values are the
# same. For example: 4 != 3
# 2. "!" before a value would reverse its Boolean value.
# 3. "!" after something would imply that the method is destructive, but that is
# not a requirement in Ruby.
# 4. "?" before something could be part of a ternary operator (? :).
# 5. "?" after a method would implies that it returns true or false.
# 6. "!!" before something would convert a value into a Boolean.
